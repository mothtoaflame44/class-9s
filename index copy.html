            what is nihilism?
            Nihilism is a philosophical belief that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Nihilists often argue that morality and knowledge are human constructs, and they tend to reject established societal norms and institutions.
            Friedrich Nietzsche: Often associated with nihilism, Nietzsche explored the implications of the "death of God" and the resulting loss of meaning in traditional values. His works, such as "Thus Spoke Zarathustra," delve into overcoming nihilism by creating one's own values.<br><br>

            Albert Camus: Known for his exploration of the absurdity of life, Camus' works, such as "The Stranger" and "The Myth of Sisyphus," address how one might live meaningfully in a seemingly indifferent universe<br><br>
            Ivan Turgenev: A Russian novelist who depicted nihilism in his novel "Fathers and Sons." His character Bazarov embodies the nihilistic mindset, rejecting traditional values and embracing cynicism.<br><br>
